This script is created to automate the process of detecting
a problematic hop from a specific source(your server) and a
destination server.

This is script is specially useful when the issue happens sporadically
and when no one is around your office. :)

Smokeping will be able to give you an information that there
is a latency.

This script will be able to give which specific hop causes that
latency.
