This script is created to automate the process of detecting<br>
a problematic hop from a specific source(your server) and a<br>
destination server.

This is script is specially useful when the issue happens sporadically<br>
and when no one is around your office. :)

Smokeping will be able to give you an information that there<br>
is a latency.

This script will be able to give which specific hop causes that<br>
latency.
