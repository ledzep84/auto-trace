This script is created to automate the process of detecting<br>
a problematic hop from a specific source(your server) and a<br>
destination server.

This is specially useful when the network issue happens<br>
sporadically and when no one is around your office. :)

Smokeping will be able to give you an information that there<br>
is a latency issue.

This script will be able to give which specific hop causes that<br>
latency.
